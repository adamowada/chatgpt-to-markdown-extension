## Prompt: Please make an example table

Sure, here's an example table:

<table><thead><tr><th>Fruit</th><th>Quantity</th><th>Price per Unit</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apples</td><td>10</td><td>$1.00</td></tr><tr><td>Bananas</td><td>5</td><td>$0.50</td></tr><tr><td>Oranges</td><td>8</td><td>$0.75</td></tr><tr><td>Pineapples</td><td>2</td><td>$2.50</td></tr><tr><td>Kiwis</td><td>12</td><td>$0.40</td></tr></tbody></table>

In this example table, we have five rows, each representing a different type of fruit. The first column lists the name of the fruit, the second column lists the quantity of that fruit available, and the third column lists the price per unit of that fruit. We can use this table to calculate the total cost of purchasing these fruits, for example.

## Prompt: Please show me an example of a bulleted list

Sure! Here's an example of a bulleted list:

Grocery list:

- Milk

- Eggs

- Bread

- Cheese

- Apples

- Carrots

- Chicken

In this example, the items are listed with bullet points, making them easier to read and separate from one another. The bullets also make it clear that each item is a separate entity in the list.
